      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p> A chicken ramen bowl is a popular Japanese dish made with a combination of noodles, broth, chicken, and various other toppings. The dish typically consists of cooked ramen noodles that are served in a savory chicken broth, which has been flavored with soy sauce, miso paste, or other seasonings. The chicken is usually sliced or shredded and added to the broth, along with vegetables such as carrots, mushrooms, and bok choy. The dish is typically garnished with green onions, sesame seeds, and sometimes a boiled egg. Chicken ramen bowls are a hearty and satisfying meal that are popular around the world.

        <li>1 jalapeno pepper, sliced, or to taste</li>

    <div class="Directions">
      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion and saute until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and ginger; cook about 30 seconds more. Add rice vinegar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, mirin, fish sauce, and sriracha sauce; stir to combine. Add chicken broth and water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer about 5 minutes. Add chicken and bok choy; simmer gently until bok choy is just tender, about 2 minutes.</li>
  
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Add ramen noodles and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and drizzle with vegetable oil to prevent sticking.</li>
  
        <li>While ramen is cooking, fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs and bring to a boil. Gently lower eggs into the boiling water and cook until yolks are barely set, about 7 minutes.</li>
  
        <li>Fill a large bowl with ice water. Transfer soft boiled eggs to the ice bath to stop the cooking process; let sit about 3 minutes. Drain eggs, carefully peel away shells, and slice in half.</li>
  
        <li>Divide ramen between 4 bowls. Add broth. Top each with jalapeno, green onions, cilantro, and soft boiled egg. Serve immediately.</li>
